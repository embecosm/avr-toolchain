#		     CLONE ALL AVR TOOL CHAIN COMPONENTS
#		     ===================================

# Run this from the tool chain directory

# Function to clone a tool. First argument is the name of the remote, second
# is the name of the tool, third the repository to clone from.
clone_tool () {
    remote=$1
    tool=$2
    repo=$3

    # Clear out anything pre-existing and clone the repo
    rm -rf ${tool}
    git clone -o ${remote} ${repo} ${tool}
}

# Clone all the AVR tools and the toolchain scripts
